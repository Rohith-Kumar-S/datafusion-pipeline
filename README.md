# datafusion-pipeline

Project Kickoff:

Goal: The goal of this project is to develop a data integration pipeline to combine data from
multiple sources into a unified format.

Scope: This project should be capable of handling both structured and unstructured data in
various formats, including JSON, XML, and YAML. It should also support image processing and
allow transformations based on the user’s requirements. Users should be able to define rules for the
provided data and reuse these rules to process similar data. The system should clean and transform
the data, converting it into a unified format based on the user’s choice. If time permits, the project
should be made scalable to handle data from big data sources, including real-time Change Data
Capture (CDC) events.
